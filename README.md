## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔢 **ABC & XYZ Analysis**: Classifies inventory by value (COGS) and demand variability (CV)
- 📦 **Warehouse Utilization**: Monitors usage vs. capacity (currently 34.08%)
- 🚚 **Transportation Cost**: Regional cost breakdown by product category
- ✅ **Order Status Tracking**: Visualizes fulfilled, pending, and cancelled orders
- 📈 **Sales Forecasting**: Time-series projection of units sold (2020–2025)
- 📊 **COGS Visualization**: Category-wise COGS segmented by ABC class
- 🧮 **ABC–XYZ Matrix**: Cross-sectional matrix to aid inventory strategy
- 🕒 **Interactive Filtering**: Slicers for Category, Region, and Year
